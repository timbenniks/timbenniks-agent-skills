## Current skills

### openapi-typescript-sdk-generator

Generates a production TypeScript SDK from an OpenAPI 3.0/3.1 spec (URL or local file). It uses human-friendly method names, requires explicit confirmation of defaults, and produces deterministic output for either a drop-in folder or a standalone package.

### sdk-readiness-audit

Audits an OpenAPI spec, GraphQL schema, or REST docs for SDK readiness. Produces a readiness scorecard, prioritized refactors, SDK pain points, and suggested OpenAPI fixes and x-* extensions.

### devex-prd-generator

Turns messy intent into a DevEx-grade PRD focused on developer journeys, non-goals, success metrics, API/SDK/docs implications, and rollout/adoption planning.
